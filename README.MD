# league_scripts
- I created this scripts to make life easyer for myself and maybe for some of you out there.
- The goal of this repository is to let you wash the dishes while the match is accepted for you so you can have time to arive at the PC.

## Installation
On the right side of this repository, you can find `Releases`.
- Click on the version wanted
- Download the `accept.zip`
- Run `accept.exe`
- Enjoy the free time that you have until you join the lobby!

## KNOWN ISSUES
#### If you have multiple screens it may not find the positions correctly.

##### Suggestion: Set the main screen as the screen where you expect the league client to appear.

## Feel free to send appreciation on Revolut @bobo1497 <3
